VSCODE tips and tricks

Select NAME
from sys.databases

allows for viewing all current databases.


Create database (insertName) allows for the creation of your new database. This does not need to be repeated. Once set up it is ready to be used.

Once the database instance is created the 
USE (database name) will bring you into that database to be manipulated with data and allow for tables to be created.
It only needs to be put in once, it doesn't need to be inputed each time you try to use that database. Very helpful.



All essential commands:
1. Shows all current databases in space.
	Select NAME
	from sys.databases

2. This creates a new data base on my server.
	Create database (insertName)
	  -lachlans_space

3. This is allows you to enter a created DataBase to 
	Use (database name)
	Use lachlans_space 

4. This shows all the tables in your database (like entering a folder) to manipulate actually use and enter code
   	-select table_name from information_schema.tables;
	






exec sp_columns project;
	select * from project;
	exec sp_columns worker;
	select * from worker;

Shows everything in the database space.
